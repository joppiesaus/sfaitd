BUGS:
* creatures can step out of lighting causing "ghosts"
* Creatures don't get updated when inside lightning(weren't discovered in first place?)
* #1 Fog of war: https://github.com/joppiesaus/sfaitd/issues/1
* You can't attack objects
? Enchantments are always players
? When you have an enchantment/effect killing a creature, OnKill isn't called. Other way of gathering XP?
? What would happen if there's already money under the creature that's dead?
