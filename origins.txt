I was relitively new to programming, and I wanted to learn about inheritance and stuff.
I don't know where I got the idea from, but I wanted to make something.
So I created ForeverAloneInThaDungeon. It was horrible. I mean, it worked,
but the code was horrible. It was quite empty;
you only had one room, the whole screen got drawn everytime you moved...
I decided to learn more about it, again. I called it SuperForeverAloneInThaDungeon.
I did some cool stuff, learned a lot again. I thought it was nice enough to post online
so people could learn from it. I did a few updates.
About a year later since the last update I started working on it again. I wanted to
implement Breadth-First Search that I just learned. I gained interest again.
In the meantime I had learned a lot of course. I realized the code was crap, but I
wanted to continue the project and add more cool stuff. I made a major update with
lots and lots of rewrites, but I still thought there were some major issues with it
(mainly spaghetti code and incosistency, not knowing how to implement things correctly)
but I kept working on it.
